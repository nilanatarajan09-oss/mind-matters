    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Nila Natarajan, a high school student and the creator of Mind Matters. I’m passionate about science, computer science, and mental health advocacy — and I wanted to combine those interests through this project.</p>
    <p>This website was built as part of the MAGIC STEM Internship 2025 to make complex research on brain health more accessible and teen-friendly.</p>

    <h2>Why I Created This</h2>
    <p>As a teen, I know how overwhelming it can be to balance school, activities, screens, and social pressures. I also know how important it is to take care of your mind — and how few resources are actually designed *for us*.</p>
    <p>Mind Matters is here to change that. I hope this site helps teens feel informed, seen, and empowered to make healthy choices for their brains.</p>
